        <h1>Course We Offer</h1>
        <p>Tokyo Jujutsu High serves not only as a training ground for the next generation of sorcerers but a headquarters for all alumni who have graduated on to be full-fledged jujutsu sorcerers as well.<br>
           All sorcerers play a role in mentoring jujutsu students, whether in a teacher's role or accompanying them on missions.<br>
            Weaker sorcerers are assigned the roles of windows,<br>
           someone who can see curses but is not considered a full-fledged sorcerer or managers to contribute as well.</p>
           <div class= "row">
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Theory</h3>
                <p>The school's curriculum is taught over four years.
                     The concept is to train young sorcerers to control their curses and use them to exorcise other curses. 
                     All classes appear to be taught by active professional jujutsu sorcerers.
                      The teachers regulate their students' training regiments and education as they see fit. Sorcerers are rare,
                     so classes are often small and focused on building up the individual students into competent sorcerers as quickly as possible.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Practicals</h3>
                <p>Practical training assignments and field tests often consist of investigating paranormal locations and exorcising weaker curses.
                   Jujutsu High students are ranked on the same scale as professional jujutsu sorcerers,
                    which their student ID reflects,Same as jujutsu sorcerers, students are given missions according to their ranking.
                     When leaving school grounds to exorcise curses as a part of their training to gain experience,
                     students are often supervised by a sorcerer or manager.</p>

                        The one Gojo sensei uses to teach his students is a small room with windows,<br>
                        desks for the students, and a blackboard alongside a teaching area.</p>

                    They can be reorganized and decorated as the student sees fit.<br>
                    Due to the low volume of students there are many empty rooms. </P>
